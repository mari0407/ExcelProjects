									<h2><a href="">ABOUT ME<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p> Hi, I am Mariana Morales. I graduated from UCSD with a degree in General Biology in 2020 and was 
										pursuing a career in Education. After graduating, I worked at Boys and Girls Club and tutored 
										my cousin in her business and accounting courses. While tutoring her I rediscovered my passion 
										for problem solving and math and decided to pursue a career in Data Analytics. I completed the Google
										Data Analytics Certificate and will be completing a masters in Business Administration.

							<p>Using an HR employee dataset from Kaggle, I created an Attrition Dashboard to provide insights of attrtion cases. 
								For the dashboard I focused specifically on employees whose attrition was yes. In order to do this, I filtered the original dataset to
								include only the cases in which employee attrtion was yes. I then copied and pasted these cases to a new sheet to create the dashboard focused 
								solely on attrtion cases.  The dashboard showcases insights into the attrtion count based on job roles,
								travel freqeincy, distance from home, years of experience, attrtion count, and overall 
								attrition percentage. I also chose to add gender, department, and overtime, as slicers  
								to highlight how attrtion count deviates between these groups. The project reflect my ability to create a dashboard and 
								use pivot tables.

									<p>This is an Employee Data dashboard. The dataset used to make this dashboard was found on Kaggle. 
			                           The dashboard displays how employee count varies by age, distance from home, and business travel freqeuncy. 
									   It also depicts how average hourly rate varies by education field and years of experience. Attrition, gender, overtime, 
									   marital statuse, and department are used as slicers to depict how they individually and as combination  
									   This dashboard reflect how the data was used to provide insights on employees.

									<p>For this analysis, using the superstore dataset from kaggle, Pivot Tables were created to determine sales by region, customers with most orders, the 5 states with highest profit and the five states with lowest profit.
										The order date column was used to insert a timeline and categories was added as a slicer.
